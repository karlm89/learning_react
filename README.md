# Learning React

These are notes from the [React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A&amp;t=510s). This is just the basics : no state manager, or hooks.

## Installing React

`> npx create-react-app [app-name]`

## Packages Used

UUID - Used for generating IDs
`> npm i uuid`

React Router - Router for React
`> npm i react-router-dom`

Axios - Used for making HTTP requests
`> npm i axios`
